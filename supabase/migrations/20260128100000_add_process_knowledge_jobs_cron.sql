-- ============================================================================
-- Add Cron Job for Knowledge Base File Processing
-- ============================================================================
-- This migration creates a cron job that triggers the process-knowledge-jobs
-- edge function every minute to process pending knowledge base file uploads.
--
-- The worker processes files in the following states:
-- - 'queued': Files that were just uploaded
-- - 'pending': Files waiting to be processed
-- - 'processing': Files that failed mid-processing (with retry logic)
--
-- Background: Files uploaded via knowledge-base-upload or brand-knowledge-upload
-- are marked with processing_status='queued'. This cron job picks them up,
-- extracts text, generates embeddings, and stores them in the vector database.
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop existing job if it exists (idempotent migration)
